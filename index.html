  	<h3>Colour Evolution</h3>
    <p>This is an example of how evolution could work in a confined environment. The hatchlings, or prey, are naive and choose their mates for reproduction randomly. They are sexually active after birth. Their offspring take 40% of their colour from each parent and another 20% is random.</p>
    <p>The predators pick from the most-visible hatchlings as prey. Those are the ones with colours most-different from the environment colour. The predators do not evolve and always get one prey per turn.</p>
    <p>Evolution in reality is much more complicated than this visualisation.</p>
